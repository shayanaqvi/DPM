dpm is just one more terminal frontend to MPD.
# Features
- browse your library  
- search for media  
- load playlists  
- manage playlist settings  
- view the current playlist  
- shuffle the entire library
# Usage
Refer to [HELP.md](HELP.md)
# Installation
At present, dpm does not have a method of installation. If you want to use it, clone the repository and run `dpm.py`. You could try using pyinstaller, however, to create a binary.
# Notice
dpm will likely not be updated in the future. In its current form, the app has many bugs and flaws. It is _usable_ nonetheless (depending on your definition of usable).
